### Text-based Adventure  
**CS 165 - Accelerated Intro to Computer Science**  
**August 2014**  
This is a simple text-based adventure.  In it, you can do many basic text-based adventure activities, like go from room to room, examine items, take and drop items, use items, save and load save files, and more.  The focus was on making the underlying engine as modular and extensible as I could manage, so adding more rooms, placing more items in rooms, and even adding entirely new items is relatively painless.

### Text Encryptor-Decryptor
**CS 344 - Operating Systems**  
**March 2015**  
This is a set of programs that programs that can encrypt or decrypt a message using a One-Time-Pad system.  It uses a client-server architecture to accomplish this.  The client (e.g. `otp_enc`) does error checking on the message and key passed to it and then sends it over a socket to the "server" (or daemon, e.g. `otp_enc_d`).  The server then performs the encryption/decryption and sends it back to the client. C.
